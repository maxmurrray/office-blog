        <h1 class="article-title">7 Best Keyboards for Typing All Day <span class="accent">(Your Fingers Deserve Better)</span></h1>
        <p class="article-subtitle">The right keyboard turns typing from a chore into a ritual.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="article-hero-image"><img src="images/hero-keyboards.png" alt="Best keyboards for typing all day"></div>

      <div class="article-body">

        <p>You type 40,000+ keystrokes per day. That's 40,000 tiny interactions between your fingers and a piece of plastic. If that piece of plastic feels mushy, wobbly, or cheap, every single one of those keystrokes is a micro-frustration. But if your keyboard sounds satisfying, feels responsive, and fits your hands? Typing becomes the best part of your workday.</p>

        <p>These seven keyboards are built for people who type all day and want to enjoy every keystroke.</p>

        <div class="article-product">
          <h2 class="article-product-number">01</h2>
          <h3 class="article-product-name"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09LGYQFRC?tag=officeblog-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NuPhy Air75 V2</a></h3>
          <div class="article-product-image"></div>
          <p class="article-product-hook">Low profile with the most satisfying "thock" in its class. Thin enough to look sleek, mechanical enough to feel incredible. PBT keycaps that never get greasy.</p>
          <p>Wireless, connects to three devices, hot swappable switches. The sound signature with the default Wisteria switches is a soft, muted pop that people on Reddit describe as "meditative." It's thin enough to use without a wrist rest but substantial enough that every keystroke registers with intention. Featured by Wired, The Verge, and CNET. This is the keyboard that converts people from membrane to mechanical.</p>
          <div class="article-product-meta">
            <span class="article-product-best-for"><strong>Best for:</strong> People switching from a laptop keyboard to their first mechanical.</span>
            <span class="article-product-price">~$110</span>
          </div>
        </div>

          <h2 class="article-product-number">02</h2>
          <h3 class="article-product-name"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BF64KDSG?tag=officeblog-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keychron Q1 Pro</a></h3>
          <div class="article-product-image"></div>
          <p class="article-product-hook">Full aluminum body. The weight and density make it feel like typing on a premium instrument. Every keystroke has a deep, satisfying resonance.</p>
          <p>The Q1 Pro is the enthusiast's entry point. CNC machined aluminum case, gasket mount that gives the typing feel a slight cushion, and full QMK/VIA programmability. The stock Gateron Jupiter Brown switches are smooth with a tactile bump that you feel without hearing. The double gasket design absorbs vibration and produces a clean, deep sound. This is the keyboard that makes people who work near you ask "what is that?"</p>
          <div class="article-product-meta">
            <span class="article-product-best-for"><strong>Best for:</strong> Enthusiasts who want premium build quality and customization.</span>

          <h3 class="article-product-name"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BT2BNJWL?tag=officeblog-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Logitech MX Keys S</a></h3>
          <div class="article-product-image"></div>
          <p class="article-product-hook">Not mechanical. And that's the point. The concave key wells guide your fingers to the center of each key. The tactile feedback is subtle but precise.</p>
          <p>Some people don't want the click and clack. The MX Keys S is for the person who wants a quiet, refined typing experience that feels effortless. The smart backlighting adapts to ambient light. It connects to three devices and switches between them with a single button. The key spacing is identical to a MacBook keyboard, so there's zero adjustment period. It's the keyboard equivalent of a luxury sedan: no drama, just smooth.</p>
          <div class="article-product-meta">
            <span class="article-product-best-for"><strong>Best for:</strong> People who want premium feel without mechanical noise.</span>

          <h3 class="article-product-name"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09J72M29Q?tag=officeblog-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HHKB Professional Hybrid Type-S</a></h3>
          <div class="article-product-image"></div>
          <p class="article-product-hook">The cult keyboard. Topre switches that feel like typing on clouds with a soft thud at the bottom. Programmers have used these for decades for a reason.</p>
          <p>The Happy Hacking Keyboard uses electrostatic capacitive switches (Topre) that feel like nothing else. The key press starts light and has a subtle "bump" followed by a cushioned landing. Silenced Type-S means the sound is a muted "thup" instead of a clack. The compact 60% layout forces you to learn key combos but rewards you with maximum desk space. This keyboard has a cult following because once you type on Topre, everything else feels harsh.</p>
          <div class="article-product-meta">
            <span class="article-product-best-for"><strong>Best for:</strong> Programmers and writers who want the most refined typing feel money can buy.</span>

          <h3 class="article-product-name"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BXNM8TSK?tag=officeblog-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kinesis Advantage360</a></h3>
          <div class="article-product-image"></div>
          <p class="article-product-hook">Split, ergonomic, concave key wells that match the natural curl of your fingers. If you've ever had wrist pain from typing, this keyboard eliminates it.</p>
          <p>The Advantage360 is the nuclear option for ergonomics. The split halves let you position each hand at natural shoulder width. The concave key wells mean your fingers travel less distance. The tenting angle reduces pronation. People with RSI, carpal tunnel, or chronic wrist pain report dramatic improvement within weeks. The learning curve is steep (2 weeks minimum) but once your muscle memory adapts, you can never go back. You'll type faster with less pain.</p>
          <div class="article-product-meta">
            <span class="article-product-best-for"><strong>Best for:</strong> Anyone with wrist or hand pain from typing.</span>

          <h3 class="article-product-name"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HML26K2?tag=officeblog-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leopold FC660M</a></h3>
          <div class="article-product-image"></div>
          <p class="article-product-hook">No RGB. No software. No wireless. Just the best stock typing experience in a compact layout. The Cherry MX switches feel broken in from day one.</p>
          <p>Leopold is the anti-hype keyboard brand. No marketing buzz, no influencer partnerships. Just incredibly well built keyboards that typists swear by. The FC660M has sound dampening foam inside the case, PBT keycaps, and double shot legends that will never fade. The 65% layout gives you arrow keys without the bulk of a full keyboard. This is the keyboard for people who just want to type, not customize.</p>
          <div class="article-product-meta">
            <span class="article-product-best-for"><strong>Best for:</strong> Purists who want excellent stock typing with zero fuss.</span>
            <span class="article-product-price">~$120</span>
          </div>
        </div>

          <h3 class="article-product-name"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085RMWPQZ?tag=officeblog-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Magic Keyboard with Touch ID</a></h3>
          <div class="article-product-image"></div>
          <p class="article-product-hook">For Mac users who love the laptop typing feel. The scissor switches are tight, responsive, and dead silent. Touch ID on a desktop keyboard is a game changer.</p>
          <p>Not everyone wants mechanical. If you love how a MacBook keyboard feels, the Magic Keyboard extends that experience to your desk. Touch ID for unlocking, Apple Pay, and password autofill is absurdly convenient. The low profile means your wrists stay flat. The aluminum body feels premium. And it pairs instantly with any Mac. Zero configuration, zero learning curve, zero noise. Sometimes the best keyboard is the one you already know how to use.</p>
          <div class="article-product-meta">
            <span class="article-product-best-for"><strong>Best for:</strong> Mac users who want seamless integration and silence.</span>
            <span class="article-product-price">~$200</span>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="article-bottom-line">
          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
          <p>Your keyboard is the thing you touch more than anything else at work. More than your phone. More than your coffee mug. Upgrading from a $20 membrane keyboard to a proper typing instrument is one of the most satisfying changes you can make to your workspace. The NuPhy Air75 V2 is the best starting point. The HHKB is the endgame. Pick one, and you'll wonder how you typed on anything else.</p>
