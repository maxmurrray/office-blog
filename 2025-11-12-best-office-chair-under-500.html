        <h1 class="article-title">7 Best Office Chairs Under $500 <span class="accent">(That Don't Feel Like $500 Compromises)</span></h1>
        <p class="article-subtitle">Your back called. It wants you to read this.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="article-body">

        <p>Here's the truth about office chairs: the $1,500 Herman Miller Aeron is incredible. But you don't need to spend $1,500 to sit comfortably for 8 hours. There are chairs under $500 that will make you forget you're sitting. Chairs so well designed that your back stops hurting, your posture improves, and you actually stay focused longer because you're not fidgeting every 20 minutes.</p>

        <p>We tested over a dozen chairs in this price range. These seven earned the spot.</p>

        <div class="article-product">
          <h2 class="article-product-number">01</h2>
          <h3 class="article-product-name"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C5KZWQXR?tag=officeblog-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HON Ignition 2.0</a></h3>
          <div class="article-product-image"><img src="images/prod-hon-ignition.png" alt="HON Ignition 2.0"></div>
          <p class="article-product-hook">The chair commercial offices buy in bulk because it works for every body type. Except now you can buy one for your home office.</p>
          <p>Mesh back that breathes, adjustable lumbar, adjustable arms, seat depth slider. It has every feature the $1,000 chairs have and costs $350. The build quality is commercial grade because it literally is a commercial chair. The lumbar support hits the exact right spot, and the recline has a smooth, weighted feel that makes leaning back during a call genuinely pleasant. This is the "nobody ever got fired for buying IBM" of office chairs.</p>
          <div class="article-product-meta">
            <span class="article-product-best-for"><strong>Best for:</strong> People who want to buy once and never think about chairs again.</span>
            <span class="article-product-price">~$350</span>
          </div>
        </div>

          <h2 class="article-product-number">02</h2>
          <h3 class="article-product-name"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T2B9TBL?tag=officeblog-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Branch Ergonomic Chair</a></h3>
          <div class="article-product-image"><img src="images/prod-branch-chair.png" alt="Branch Ergonomic Chair"></div>
          <p class="article-product-hook">Looks like a $900 chair. Costs $350. The Italian mesh back has a flexibility that hugs your spine without feeling like a hammock.</p>
          <p>Branch nailed the aesthetics. This chair looks like it belongs in a startup that just raised their Series B. White frame, clean lines, no gamer energy. But beyond looks, the lumbar adjusts both height and depth, the armrests move in four directions, and the seat cushion stays comfortable even at hour six. The 12 year warranty tells you everything about their confidence in the build.</p>
          <div class="article-product-meta">
            <span class="article-product-best-for"><strong>Best for:</strong> Design conscious people who want ergonomics without the ugly.</span>
            <span class="article-product-price">~$350</span>

          <h3 class="article-product-name"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L5RSP1F?tag=officeblog-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steelcase Series 1</a></h3>
          <div class="article-product-image"><img src="images/prod-steelcase-series1.png" alt="Steelcase Series 1"></div>
          <p class="article-product-hook">Made by the same company that makes the $1,400 Leap. This is their entry point and it's shockingly good for the price.</p>
          <p>Steelcase doesn't make bad chairs. Even their cheapest option has the LiveBack technology that flexes with your spine. The weight activated mechanism means you don't have to fiddle with tension knobs. Just sit down and it adjusts. The seat is firmer than most competitors, which some people love for long sessions. If brand pedigree matters to you, this is it.</p>
          <div class="article-product-meta">
            <span class="article-product-best-for"><strong>Best for:</strong> People who trust the brand and want the entry point to premium.</span>
            <span class="article-product-price">~$415</span>

          <h3 class="article-product-name"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932GC8KN?tag=officeblog-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Autonomous ErgoChair Pro</a></h3>
          <div class="article-product-image"><img src="images/prod-ergochair-pro.png" alt="Autonomous ErgoChair Pro"></div>
          <p class="article-product-hook">Every single thing on this chair adjusts. Armrest height, angle, width. Seat tilt, depth. Back recline, headrest. It's like a cockpit for sitting.</p>
          <p>The ErgoChair Pro is for the person who wants to dial in their exact perfect position and never move again. It has more adjustment points than chairs twice its price. The woven mesh back has a satisfying give when you lean into it. The headrest actually cradles your neck instead of pushing your head forward. At $500 it's the ceiling of this list, but you're getting a chair that genuinely competes with the $800+ range.</p>
          <div class="article-product-meta">
            <span class="article-product-best-for"><strong>Best for:</strong> Tinkerers who want to customize every angle of how they sit.</span>
            <span class="article-product-price">~$500</span>

          <h3 class="article-product-name"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JNKFCWM?tag=officeblog-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flexispot BS10</a></h3>
          <div class="article-product-image"><img src="images/prod-flexispot-bs10.png" alt="Flexispot BS10"></div>
          <p class="article-product-hook">The sleeper pick. Nobody talks about this chair and it outperforms half the list. The lumbar support is built into the backrest curve itself.</p>
          <p>Flexispot is known for standing desks, but their BS10 chair is quietly excellent. The integrated lumbar curve means there's no separate lumbar pad to adjust or break. The mesh is taut and supportive without being stiff. And at $280, it's the best value on this list by a wide margin. The only downside: the armrests aren't as adjustable as pricier options. But for the money, nothing comes close.</p>
          <div class="article-product-meta">
            <span class="article-product-best-for"><strong>Best for:</strong> Budget conscious buyers who don't want to sacrifice comfort.</span>

          <h3 class="article-product-name"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L26MVYB?tag=officeblog-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SIDIZ T80</a></h3>
          <div class="article-product-image"><img src="images/prod-sidiz-t80.png" alt="SIDIZ T80"></div>
          <p class="article-product-hook">Korean ergonomic engineering. The S-curve backrest follows your spine like it was molded to your body. The tilt mechanism is butter smooth.</p>
          <p>SIDIZ is massive in Korea where office chair culture is taken seriously. The T80 has a unique forward tilt option that's perfect for focused desk work, leaning you slightly toward your screen instead of away from it. The seat foam is dense and doesn't bottom out. The mesh back has a slight flex that rewards fidgeting. And the build quality feels like something that will last a decade.</p>
          <div class="article-product-meta">
            <span class="article-product-best-for"><strong>Best for:</strong> People who lean forward when they work and need a chair that supports that.</span>
            <span class="article-product-price">~$400</span>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="article-product">
          <h2 class="article-product-number">07</h2>
          <h3 class="article-product-name"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPR3RHBR?tag=officeblog-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sihoo Doro S300</a></h3>
          <div class="article-product-image"><img src="images/prod-sihoo-doro.png" alt="Sihoo Doro S300"></div>
          <p class="article-product-hook">The viral chair. Blew up on YouTube for a reason. The anti-gravity mechanism makes reclining feel like floating. At $350 it's borderline unfair to the competition.</p>
          <p>The Doro S300 has a weight distribution system that makes leaning back feel weightless. Not springy, not floppy. Weightless. The dual mesh system (firmer on the lumbar, softer on the upper back) means support where you need it and give where you want it. The headrest adjusts in three dimensions. Every YouTuber who reviewed this chair bought a second one. That says everything.</p>
          <div class="article-product-meta">
            <span class="article-product-best-for"><strong>Best for:</strong> People who recline during calls and want it to feel like a cloud.</span>
            <span class="article-product-price">~$350</span>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="article-bottom-line">
          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
          <p>Your chair is probably the most important thing in your entire office setup. Think about it. You sit in it 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. That's more time than you spend in your bed. Investing in a good one is a no brainer. You'll work longer because you're comfortable, your back will actually be straight for once, and your posture on Zoom calls? Chef's kiss. Trust me, a nice chair looks good on camera. The sweet spot is $300 to $400. Spend it once, never think about it again.</p>
