        <h1 class="article-title">8 Desk Plants That Actually <span class="accent">Boost Your Productivity</span></h1>
        <p class="article-subtitle">NASA studied this. Your desk should have a plant on it.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="article-body">

        <p>A NASA study found that certain plants remove up to 87% of air toxins in 24 hours. A University of Exeter study found that offices with plants saw a 15% increase in productivity. A human study (me, last Tuesday) found that looking at a tiny pothos on my desk made me 100% less likely to throw my laptop out the window during a Zoom call.</p>

        <p>Plants on your desk aren't decoration. They're functional. Better air, better mood, better focus. Here are the ones that actually work in an office, won't die from neglect, and look good doing it.</p>

        <div class="article-product">
          <h2 class="article-product-number">01</h2>
          <h3 class="article-product-name"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=pothos+plant+live&tag=officeblog-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pothos (Devil's Ivy)</a></h3>
          <div class="article-product-image"><img src="images/prod-pothos.png" alt="Pothos plant"></div>
          <p class="article-product-hook">Literally impossible to kill. Grows in low light. Purifies air. The trailing vines look gorgeous hanging off a shelf above your monitor.</p>
          <p>Pothos is the starter plant for every desk. It thrives in fluorescent lighting, needs water maybe once a week, and grows fast enough that you feel like you're accomplishing something. The heart shaped leaves are naturally calming. Put it in a simple white ceramic pot on the corner of your desk and it instantly adds life to an otherwise sterile workspace. If you kill a pothos, plants might not be for you.</p>

          <h3 class="article-product-name"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=snake+plant+small+desk&tag=officeblog-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snake Plant (Sansevieria)</a></h3>
          <div class="article-product-image"><img src="images/prod-snake-plant.png" alt="Snake Plant"></div>
          <p class="article-product-hook">Produces oxygen at night (most plants don't). Architectural and sculptural. Needs water every 2 to 3 weeks. Basically a piece of living furniture.</p>
          <p>The snake plant was in the original NASA clean air study and ranked highest for filtering formaldehyde, which leaks from carpets, furniture, and paint in your office. The vertical leaves have a modern, structural look that works on any desk. Small varieties fit perfectly next to a monitor. It tolerates low light, dry air, and total neglect. The perfect plant for people who want the benefits without the maintenance.</p>

          <h3 class="article-product-name"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=zz+plant+small&tag=officeblog-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZZ Plant</a></h3>
          <div class="article-product-image"><img src="images/prod-zz-plant.png" alt="ZZ Plant"></div>
          <p class="article-product-hook">Glossy, dark green leaves that look like they're made of wax. Thrives on neglect. Seriously, overwatering is the only way to kill it.</p>
          <p>ZZ plants store water in their thick rhizomes, which means they can go weeks without a drink. The glossy leaves reflect light and add a subtle shine to your desk. They grow slowly, so they stay the size you bought them for a long time. The dark green pairs beautifully with warm wood desks and earth tone setups. This is the plant for the person who travels for work and comes back to find everything else dead.</p>

          <div class="article-product-image"><img src="images/prod-peace-lily.png" alt="Peace Lily"></div>
          <p class="article-product-hook">The only desk plant that blooms. White flowers appear a few times a year and they look elegant without trying. Also topped the NASA air quality list.</p>
          <p>Peace lilies remove benzene, trichloroethylene, and ammonia from the air. The white blooms against dark green leaves give your desk a spa-like quality. They do need a bit more water than the others on this list (they'll dramatically droop when thirsty, which is actually helpful because they literally tell you when to water them). The emotional payoff of seeing a flower bloom on your desk in the middle of winter is surprisingly real.</p>

          <div class="article-product-image"><img src="images/prod-succulents.png" alt="Succulents"></div>
          <p class="article-product-hook">Tiny, sculptural, endlessly varied. A cluster of three different succulents in small pots looks like a miniature art installation on your desk.</p>
          <p>Succulents need bright indirect light and water every 2 weeks. The texture variety is what makes them special. Combine a spiky haworthia, a round echeveria, and a trailing string of pearls and your desk has a tiny ecosystem. The satisfaction of watching them slowly grow new leaves is a surprisingly effective stress reliever. Keep them near a window if possible. A grow light works too.</p>

          <h3 class="article-product-name"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=english+ivy+plant+small&tag=officeblog-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">English Ivy</a></h3>
          <div class="article-product-image"><img src="images/prod-english-ivy.png" alt="English Ivy"></div>
          <p class="article-product-hook">Reduces airborne mold by up to 78%. The trailing vines create a natural, cottage-core vibe on your bookshelf or desk edge.</p>
          <p>English ivy is one of the most effective air purifiers for mold spores, which matters in humid offices or basements. The cascading vines look stunning trailing off a shelf above your workspace. It prefers cooler temperatures (perfect for AC offices) and moderate light. The leaves are small and delicate, giving your space a softer, more organic feel. It grows fast enough to be rewarding but manageable enough to keep trimmed.</p>
          <div class="article-product-meta">
            <span class="article-product-best-for"><strong>Best for:</strong> Basement office workers and anyone with allergies.</span>

          <h3 class="article-product-name"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=rubber+plant+small&tag=officeblog-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rubber Plant (Ficus Elastica)</a></h3>
          <div class="article-product-image"><img src="images/prod-rubber-plant.png" alt="Rubber Plant"></div>
          <p class="article-product-hook">Big, bold, dark burgundy leaves that make a statement. One of the best plants for removing formaldehyde from indoor air.</p>
          <p>The rubber plant is the "one big plant" option. Instead of clustering small pots, you place one rubber plant on the floor next to your desk and it anchors the entire space. The thick, leathery leaves in deep green or burgundy are visually grounding. It grows tall, so it fills vertical space that would otherwise be empty. Water when the top inch of soil is dry. It's forgiving, dramatic, and makes your office look like it was designed by an interior decorator.</p>
          <div class="article-product-meta">
            <span class="article-product-best-for"><strong>Best for:</strong> People who want one statement plant instead of several small ones.</span>
            <span class="article-product-price">~$20</span>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="article-product">
          <h2 class="article-product-number">08</h2>
          <h3 class="article-product-name"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=lavender+plant+indoor+small&tag=officeblog-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lavender</a></h3>
          <div class="article-product-image"><img src="images/prod-lavender.png" alt="Lavender"></div>
          <p class="article-product-hook">The only plant on this list that affects your mood through scent. The aroma of lavender has been clinically shown to reduce anxiety and improve focus.</p>
          <p>Lavender needs a sunny spot (south facing window or a grow light), but if you can give it that, the payoff is enormous. The scent is subtle and constant. You don't need to crush the leaves or anything. Just having it on your desk releases enough aroma to calm your nervous system. Studies from Kagoshima University showed lavender scent reduced mental stress markers by 20%. It's aromatherapy that waters itself.</p>
          <div class="article-product-meta">
            <span class="article-product-best-for"><strong>Best for:</strong> Stressed out workers with a sunny window.</span>
            <span class="article-product-price">~$12</span>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="article-bottom-line">
          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
          <p>Honestly, there's no reason not to have a plant on your desk. It costs less than your morning coffee and it just sits there making your air better and your mood lighter. Plus, there's something weirdly satisfying about keeping something alive on your desk. It's like a tiny win every day. Start with a pothos. I'm serious, you would have to actively try to kill this thing. And if your office looks half as good as it smells with a lavender plant in the corner? Your coworkers are going to think you hired an interior designer.</p>
