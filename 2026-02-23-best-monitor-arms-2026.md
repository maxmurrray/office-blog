Your monitor is probably sitting on its stock stand. That chunky plastic base that eats up desk space and forces you to look down like you're being scolded.

A monitor arm fixes both problems. One clamp. Your monitor floats. Your desk suddenly has room for actual stuff. Your neck stops hurting. And the best part? Adjusting it becomes this tiny satisfying ritual every morning where you dial in the perfect angle.

Here are nine monitor arms that do it right.

## 1. Ergotron HX Desk Arm

**Why it's satisfying:** The tension adjustment knob has this precise, weighted feel. You turn it once and the monitor stays exactly where you put it. No drift. No sag.

This is the arm that every other arm tries to beat. Ergotron invented the category and the HX is their flagship. Handles monitors up to 42 inches and 42 pounds. The Constant Force technology means you can reposition your monitor with one finger and it holds position indefinitely. The aluminum construction is overbuilt in the best way. People buy this once and never think about it again.

**Best for:** Anyone with a heavy or ultrawide monitor who wants zero compromise.
**Price:** ~$450

## 2. Humanscale M8.1

**Why it's satisfying:** No knobs. No levers. No adjustments. You literally grab the monitor and move it. The counterbalance mechanism does everything automatically.

Humanscale engineered this thing to disappear. There's nothing to configure. The spring mechanism auto-adjusts to your monitor's weight. You reposition it throughout the day without thinking. The build quality is ridiculous, all die-cast aluminum with hidden cable channels. It's also the best looking arm here, which matters if you care about aesthetics. Architects and designers gravitate toward this one.

**Best for:** People who want premium design and zero fiddling.
**Price:** ~$550

## 3. Uplift V2 Monitor Arm

**Why it's satisfying:** The gas spring adjustment is smooth and the cable management clips snap into place with a reassuring click. Everything feels engineered.

Uplift makes standing desks and they brought that same attention to detail here. The arm supports monitors up to 32 inches and 20 pounds. The cable management system is genuinely clever, with clips that route everything cleanly along the arm. The clamp is tool-free and fits desks up to 3.5 inches thick. At $179 it's half the price of the Ergotron while delivering 90% of the performance.

**Best for:** Most people. Best balance of price and performance.
**Price:** ~$179

## 4. Amazon Basics Premium Single Monitor Stand

**Why it's satisfying:** The tension adjustment actually works. For a budget arm, it doesn't feel budget when you're using it.

This is the arm that converted a lot of people. At $120 it undercuts everything while still feeling solid. The gas spring lift is smooth. The cable management is basic but functional. The clamp is sturdy aluminum. It handles monitors up to 32 inches and 25 pounds. Is it as refined as the Ergotron? No. But for most people the difference doesn't justify spending three times as much.

**Best for:** Budget conscious buyers who still want quality.
**Price:** ~$120

## 5. Grovemade Monitor Arm

**Why it's satisfying:** Walnut and aluminum. You touch warm wood every time you adjust your monitor. It's the only arm that feels like furniture, not office equipment.

Grovemade makes premium desk accessories by hand in Portland. Their monitor arm is the only one that uses real wood. The walnut or oak accent plate sits where your hand grips to adjust. The aluminum is bead blasted and anodized. Cable routing is completely hidden inside the arm. It's also the most beautiful arm you can buy. If your desk is a curated setup and you care about how things look, this is the one.

**Best for:** Design focused setups where aesthetics matter.
**Price:** ~$495

## 6. VIVO Dual Monitor Arm

**Why it's satisfying:** Two monitors. One clamp. The symmetry of aligning them perfectly side by side hits different.

VIVO dominates the budget dual arm category. This thing holds two monitors up to 32 inches each. The arms are fully independent so you can position each monitor exactly where you want. The cable management includes spiral wraps that keep everything tidy. At $70 it's absurd value. The build is more steel than aluminum but it's solid. People who go from dual monitor stands to this arm describe it as life changing.

**Best for:** Dual monitor setups on a budget.
**Price:** ~$70

## 7. Ergotron LX Dual Side by Side

**Why it's satisfying:** The same legendary Ergotron feel but doubled. Both monitors float independently with zero sag.

This is the dual monitor version of the HX. Each arm handles 25 pounds independently. The Clamp Hub Base means one clamp point for both arms. The cable management is integrated and clean. You can position monitors side by side, or angle them inward for an immersive setup. At $350 it's half the price of buying two separate HX arms. For dual monitor power users, this is the gold standard.

**Best for:** Serious dual monitor users who want premium performance.
**Price:** ~$350

## 8. IKEA FREDDE Monitor Stand

**Why it's satisfying:** It's not an arm. It's a fixed stand. But at $30 it solves the height problem without any complexity.

Including this because not everyone wants or needs an arm. The FREDDE is a fixed height stand that raises your monitor 5 inches. It has a shelf underneath for a keyboard or storage. The steel construction is solid. It's not adjustable but it's also one tenth the price of a premium arm. For people on a tight budget or in a shared workspace, this gets your monitor to eye level without any investment.

**Best for:** Minimal budgets or temporary setups.
**Price:** ~$30

## 9. Lamicall Gooseneck Monitor Arm

**Why it's satisfying:** The flexible gooseneck bends and stays. You can position your monitor in orientations that rigid arms can't do.

This is the wildcard. The gooseneck design means you can position your monitor vertically, horizontally, or anywhere in between. It's great for secondary monitors or ultrawides that need unusual positioning. The steel construction is surprisingly rigid once you set it. The clamp fits desks up to 3 inches. At $90 it's priced between budget and mid range. The tradeoff is the gooseneck can't handle heavy monitors, maxing out at 17 pounds.

**Best for:** Secondary monitors or unusual positioning needs.
**Price:** ~$90

## The Bottom Line

A monitor arm is one of those upgrades where you wonder why you waited. Your desk instantly has more space. Your posture improves because your monitor is at eye level instead of looking down. And the ability to pull your monitor closer or push it away throughout the day keeps you from getting stiff.

The Uplift V2 is where I'd start for most people. It's well built, reasonably priced, and handles the vast majority of monitors. If you have a heavy ultrawide or just want the absolute best, get the Ergotron HX. If you're on a tight budget, the Amazon Basics arm punches way above its weight.

Your neck will thank you. Your desk will look better. And adjusting your monitor will become this tiny satisfying moment in your morning routine instead of something you never think about.
